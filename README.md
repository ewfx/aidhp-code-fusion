## 🎯 Introduction
Modern customers expect personalized experiences that cater to their unique preferences. This project implements an **AI-driven hyper-personalization and recommendation system** that dynamically generates recommendations based on customer profiles, sentiment analysis, social media activity, and purchase history.

This solution leverages **Generative AI techniques** to enhance personalization and provide **real-time insights** for businesses to optimize customer engagement.

## 💡 Inspiration
In today's world, businesses strive to improve customer experience through **personalized recommendations**. By leveraging AI, we can enhance how businesses interact with customers, predict preferences, and offer **tailored product suggestions** that improve engagement and retention.

## ⚙️ What It Does
🔹 Analyzes customer **purchase history, sentiment, and engagement**
🔹 Uses **embeddings and similarity scores** for intelligent recommendations
🔹 Supports **hybrid, contextual, and collaborative filtering** strategies
🔹 Provides **business insights** for customer retention and risk analysis
🔹 Offers a user-friendly **Streamlit-based interface** for interaction

## 🛠️ How We Built It
1. **Data Processing:** Encodes categorical data (e.g., gender, social media activity) and pre-processes customer datasets.
2. **Embeddings & Similarity:** Uses **Sentence-Transformers** to generate embeddings and compute **cosine similarity**.
3. **Recommendation Engine:** Implements **collaborative, contextual, and hybrid filtering** to generate personalized suggestions.
4. **Frontend (Streamlit):** Builds an interactive UI for users to explore recommendations.
5. **Visualization & Insights:** Uses **Plotly** for customer profile visualizations.

## 🚧 Challenges We Faced
🔸 **Handling sparse customer data** for better generalization
🔸 **Fine-tuning embeddings** for high-accuracy recommendations
🔸 **Avoiding bias in AI-driven decisions** while maintaining fairness
🔸 **Optimizing response time** for real-time personalization

## 🏃 How to Run
1. **Clone the repository**  
   https://github.com/ewfx/aidhp-code-fusion.git
  
2. **Navigate to the project directory**
   cd CodeFusion

3. **Install dependencies**   
   pip install -r requirements.txt
 
4. **Run the application**
   streamlit run main.py
